| 7. Leaderboard + seasons + realtime | Done |
| 8. Polish, Dutch copy pass, app icons | Done |

`/upgrade` turns a guest into a real account in place: same `SignInCubit`, built
with `SignInMode.upgrade`, which routes the two email steps to
`upgradeGuestWithEmail` / `verifyUpgradeCode` (Supabase `updateUser` + an
`emailChange` OTP) instead of a fresh sign-in. Every place that refuses a guest
renders `GuestNotice`, which carries the refusal *and* the way out; the page pops
itself when `AuthBloc` reports the user is no longer anonymous.

`/c/:id` is the tab shell (`features/competition/.../competition_detail_page.dart`):
Leaderboard (default), Matches, Players. The leaderboard tab carries the season
switcher; the season list is `seasons` plus, stitched in front of it, the
current calendar window — which has no row until the first match lands in it.

`/c/:id/match/new` builds the teams and submits; `/c/:id/match/:matchId` shows
the per-player before → after and lets the creator or the owner change the
score or delete the match. Both are pushed on top of the shell, so they build
their own cubits; the shell reloads its list and overview whenever one of them
pops.

## Product decisions (already settled — do not relitigate)

- **Two teams per match**, arbitrary sizes each side.
- **Team rating = mean of members**; every member takes the same delta. Zero-sum.
- **Margin of victory is ON**, with an autocorrelation damper and a cap.
  `k_factor` / `mov_enabled` / `mov_cap` are per-competition columns so it can
  be tuned or disabled without a migration.
- **Seasons hard-reset** everyone to `starting_rating` (1000). Calendar-aligned
  monthly / quarterly / yearly in the competition's timezone.
- **Draws allowed**, scored 0.5.
- **No match confirmation** — a submitted result counts immediately.
- **Edits/deletes replay the season** via `recalc_season`.
- **Auth**: Apple, Google, email OTP code. No passwords.
- **Guests** (Supabase anonymous) may join a competition and read it. They may
  not create competitions, add players, or log matches. Enforced in Postgres.
- Online only. English + Dutch. Cupertino on iOS/macOS, Material 3 elsewhere.

## Architecture

```
lib/
  app/          router (+ auth redirect), DI, app shell, splash screen
  core/         config, error, theme, widgets/adaptive, widgets/state_views
  features/<name>/
    domain/     entities + abstract repository
    data/       Supabase-backed repository implementation
    presentation/ blocs + pages + widgets
  l10n/         app_en.arb, app_nl.arb (+ generated app_localizations*.dart)
```

Conventions that matter:

- **No comments.** Only write one when it is absolutely necessary — something
  the code genuinely cannot express itself. Doc comments count as comments.
  Naming and structure carry the explanation. (Explicit user preference.)
- **No freezed, no build_runner, no json_serializable.** Plain classes with
  `Equatable` and hand-written `fromMap`. (Explicit user preference.)
- **No usecase layer.** Blocs call repositories directly.
- **Feature code never imports `package:flutter/cupertino.dart` or Material
  widgets directly.** Everything platform-specific goes through
  `core/widgets/adaptive/adaptive.dart`. `AppPlatform.useCupertino` is the single
  switch, and `AppPlatform.debugOverrideCupertino` pins it in tests.
- **The accent and team colours are resolved through `AdaptiveColors`, never
  read off `AppColors` directly.** Each carries a second value for dark
  surfaces; a saturated mid-tone sits near 4:1 on a dark background whatever its
  hue. `test/core/adaptive_colors_test.dart` asserts the ratios against the
  app's own surface — note that surface is a warm tint, not white, so measuring
  against `#FFFFFF` flatters a colour by roughly 0.2.
- **All repository methods wrap their body in `guard()`** from
  `core/error/failure.dart`, which converts Postgrest/socket exceptions into a
  sealed `Failure`. UI renders them via `failure.localized(l10n)`.
- Messages raised by our own SQL (`RAISE EXCEPTION 'Create an account to log
  matches'`) are written for humans and pass through to the UI unchanged.
- **Every user-facing string goes through `AppLocalizations`.** Add to both ARB
  files, then `flutter gen-l10n`.
- Blocs that hold form state are `registerFactory`; session-wide ones are
  `registerLazySingleton`; ones scoped to a single competition are
  `registerFactoryParam<T, String, void>` and take the id as a constructor
  argument (`getIt<PlayersCubit>(param1: id)`). See `lib/app/di/injector.dart`.
  `MatchDetailCubit` uses both slots (`param1` match id, `param2` competition
  id) because it needs the owner to decide who may delete.
- **Realtime is a tick, never a payload.** `core/data/realtime.dart` turns a
  `postgres_changes` subscription into a `Stream<void>`; the cubit debounces it
  by 400 ms and refetches. This is not laziness: one `create_match` on the demo
  competition emitted **36** `player_ratings` events and 14 `matches` events,
  because a back-dated match replays the whole season and every replayed match
  rewrites its own rating snapshot. Reconciling that stream row by row would
  cost more than the refetch and could not keep `rank` consistent anyway.
- **A write blocked by an RLS policy is not an error.** `update … where` simply
  matches no rows, so repositories end those calls with `.select().maybeSingle()`
  and raise `PermissionFailure` on null. Getting this wrong looks like a silent
  success. `supabase/tests/players_check.sql` asserts the premise.

## Database workflow — read this before touching SQL

`supabase link` needs a Management API access token we do not have, so
**migrations are applied with `psql` via `scripts/db.sh`, not `supabase db
push`.** The script reads `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` and `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`
from the project-root `.env`.

- The project's direct DB host is **IPv6-only**; the `aws-0`/`aws-1` poolers
  reject this tenant. `scripts/db.sh` already targets the right host.
- After applying a migration by hand, record it:
  `insert into supabase_migrations.schema_migrations (version, name) values (…)`
  so a future `supabase db push` picks up cleanly.
- **Re-applying a `create or replace function` drops its grants.** Always
  re-issue `grant execute on function … to authenticated` afterwards.

### Two `.env` files — do not confuse them

- `assets/.env` — **bundled into the app**, readable by anyone, and **tracked
  in git on purpose**. Client config only (`SUPABASE_URL`,
  `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, the `AUTH_*` flags) — safe to ship, since RLS is
  what protects the data, not this key. `Env.load()` throws in debug if a
  password/secret/token key ever appears here, so a real secret can't land in
  it by accident.
- `.env` (project root) — tooling secrets (`SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`). Gitignored,
  never bundled, no template committed.

### SQL gotchas already hit here

- OUT parameters shadow column names — **table-qualify everything** inside
  functions with `RETURNS TABLE`.
- An untyped enum literal in a `UNION` branch resolves as `text`; cast it
  (`'a'::public.match_team`).
- PostgREST coerces `""` to `NULL` for `uuid` params, so an empty string is not
  a validation error — it is a missing argument.

## Testing

- `EloCalculator` (Dart) mirrors `public.elo_delta` (SQL). **The same fixture
  values are asserted in both** — `test/features/match/elo_calculator_test.dart`
  and `supabase/seed.sql`. If you change one, change both.
- `supabase/seed.sql` asserts that building a season incrementally and replaying
  it with `recalc_season` produce identical ratings. That invariant is what
  makes edits and deletes safe.
- `supabase/tests/rls_check.sql` runs as `authenticated` inside a rolled-back
  transaction and proves outsiders see nothing and direct writes are refused.
  It caught nothing that the seed did, because the seed runs as `postgres` —
  **server-side assertions do not exercise the client path.** Verify RPCs over
  REST with a real token as well.
- **The guest → account upgrade is the one flow still unverified server-side.**
  It cannot be checked the way the RPCs were: `verifyUpgradeCode` needs a token
  that only arrives by email. Seeding `auth.users.email_change_token_new` by
  hand and calling `/auth/v1/verify` does not work — GoTrue rejected the raw
  value via both `token_hash` and `email`+`token`, and rejected sha224 and
  sha256 of `email+otp` too, always as `otp_expired`. Minting a real token needs
  `admin/generate_link`, which needs a service-role key that is not in `.env`.
  So it is either that key, or a real send to a readable inbox.
- The step 6 RPCs were checked that way against the live project: sign in
  anonymously over `/auth/v1/signup`, flip `auth.users.is_anonymous` to false,
  refresh the token, then call `join_competition` → `create_match` →
  `update_match_score` → `delete_match`. It confirms the part psql cannot:
  `uuid[]` parameters coerce from a JSON array, and a guest's `create_match`
  fails with our own `P0001` message rather than a PostgREST signature error.
  Snapshot `md5(string_agg(player_id||rating))` over `player_ratings` before
  and after — deleting the probe match must restore it exactly.
- Realtime was verified the same way, with a throwaway `dart run` script using
  the `supabase` package (`client.realtime.setAuth(token)`, then
  `onPostgresChanges` on `player_ratings` filtered by `season_id` and on
  `matches` filtered by `competition_id`). Both channels deliver to a member
  through RLS. `flutter test` cannot cover this: the cubits are tested against
  a `StreamController`, which proves the debounce and the refetch but says
  nothing about whether the server actually publishes.

## Live project

- Ref `ycyydncwwoxmcxibyeuk`. Seeded demo competition **"Office Table Tennis"**,
  join code **HDHS39**, 5 players, 11 matches, 3 unclaimed placeholders.
- Anonymous sign-ins: enabled. Apple/Google: **not** configured, so those
  buttons stay hidden behind `AUTH_APPLE_ENABLED` / `AUTH_GOOGLE_ENABLED`.
